*** i believe the issue is with the way that i created the npz files. after evaluating on the old datasets, everything seemed fine.

*** The bad performance of the classifier is due to the format of the dataset.
**** Evaluating on the original data ( not the electron data that I needed to remove the pdgid selection for) the numbers seem reasonable.
**** If the training data is not the same as what I'm evaluating on, and I can evaluate over both the higgsino and electron datasets with both the classifier and map, I should be fine.
